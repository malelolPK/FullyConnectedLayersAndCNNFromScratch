# MNIST Classification  

This project implements two different approaches to classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset:  

1. **Linear Model (from scratch)** – Implemented with manual forward and backward propagation, without using high-level frameworks like PyTorch autograd.  
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, using PyTorch)** – Built using PyTorch's modules for ease of implementation and training.  

## Key Features  
- **Custom-built linear model** with manually implemented backpropagation.  
- **CNN model using PyTorch**, leveraging convolutional layers for better accuracy.  
- Training and testing scripts included.  
- Visualization tools to inspect model performance.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  test
